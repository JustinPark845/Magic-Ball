# React-Native-TypeScript-Learning
This is a project that I attempted while learning to implement TypeScript into React Native. It is a basic 8-ball application, which returns results based on api request success or failures.
# How to Run
In order to run this program, you must first prepare the react-native environment by following the documentation at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. Then you must download either Expo on your device or an andorid or ios simulator. Once finished, run "npm start" in the terminal and follow the instructions for a smooth experience!
